# Python extension using C

This is an easy to follow sample module that shows you how you can extend Python with C. This example goes hand in hand with the official documentation which is available at the following link: [link](https://docs.python.org/3.6/extending/extending.html)


## Todo:
1. A regular C extension -- DONE
2. Make C API so I can also embed C++ within C
3. A complete separate C++ extension
